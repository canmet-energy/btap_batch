  :no_of_threads:

  # Choices are:
  #       local : Run locally.. Good to test out runs on small batches before sending to AWS.
  #       aws_batch: use for analyses with > 1000 simulations: This is currently only available for NRCan staff.  If you would wish to make used of Amazon cloud computing, please contact us.

  # Use btap_public_cli for full opensource version. For btap_private_cli to use costing. Contact us if you wish to work with costing data.

  # Set to True if you wish to build the image from scratch with the below branches fresh,
  # pulling from the most recent branches indicated below. If set to false, it will use the last version built locally or
  # on AWS. This can save time (~10minute) if set to false when you have already built the image and expect no changes.

  # Branch from https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards. Typically 'nrcan_prod' branch.
  # Developers or people liking to work on unstable code can use 'nrcan'

  # Branch from https://github.com/canmet-energy/btap_costing. Typically 'nrcan_prod'
  # Developers or people liking to work on unstable code can use 'master'

  :os_version: '3.2.1'

  # The name of the analysis. Can be a user friendly name. This is how it will appear on your local system or on the S3

  # This will automatically create comparisons to the reference cases generated in the analysis.
